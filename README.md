# SGEMM-GPU-kernel-PERFORMANCE
Checking efficiency of SGEMM GPU kernel performance with the help of independent variables, (explanatory variables) giving some arithmetic calculation like matrices multiply with other matrices and it was measured by multiple runtime's how fast it was calculated. TO predict the dependent variables (response variables) from the actual values
After analysis on SGEMM GPU performance it will goto mass production and deployment state
